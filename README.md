# Single-Responsiblity

Single Responsibility Principle means that each class only has 1 class so that it can only change one task given. The Open/Closed principle means that a class that has been written must be easy to inherit and cannot be changed. If you want to change it, it must be passed down to a class that has a new behavior.
